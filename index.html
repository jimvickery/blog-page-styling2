					I've spent this week learning so much more about javascript features than I had known ever existed. 
					Most of which consists of but not limited to:
					<<ul>
						<li>Browserify - I like how it can modularize code like IIFE's but with easier implementation.</li>
						<li>Grunt - What's not to like about this framwork. It makes real-time code so much easier with built in error detection.</li>
						<li>Firebase - I've been using Firebase for 6 months but only as a backend for IOS apps. Its' been nice to see it used on websites.</li>
						<li>Promise - A nice feature that helps load JSON and other content in an organized sequnece. I like it.</li>
				
					</ul>
